# num_searches - default number of searches performed by the en.gine, per position,
# unless uci specifies a different number or infinite search
# default: 4000
num_searches: 4000

# c_puct - exploration factor of the engine.
# It is not recommended to use values outside the range (0.5, 2).
# Lower Values (e.g., 0.5 - 1.0) may result in less accurate, but more diverse and interesting play.
# Higher Values (e.g., 1.5 - 2.0) may result in deeper search of the most promising lines, improving accuracy.
# default: 1
c_puct: 1

# model_path - path to your NN model.
# default: model.pt
model_path: model.pt

# cache_size: size of the internal inference cache in Mb.
# The engine stores results of inference in an internal cache.
# This cache is required for the engine to acheive a meaningful result.
# It is not recommended to go below 128Mb for normal matches, and below 512Mb for analysis.
# Increasing this value further should not be required under normal circumstances.
# default: 512
cache_size: 4096

# allow the engine to utilize multiple threads for faster search
# default: True
multi_threaded: True

# model parameters # do not change unless you have your own model to load
# num_blocks: number of residual blocks
# default: 19
# num_blocks: 12
# num_blocks: 14

# num_features: number of channels in each convolutional layer
